# 🧠 Java Practice Programs

Welcome to my Java Practice Repository! 🚀  
This space is dedicated to sharpening and expanding my Java programming skills through hands-on problem-solving and experimentation.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Reinforce core Java concepts.
- Explore advanced Java topics and libraries.
- Improve problem-solving using object-oriented principles.
- Build a strong foundation for real-world software testing.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is neatly organized into topic-based folders for easy navigation:

| Main Topics | Sub Topics |

| 04_variables_and_operators | Variables(Local, instance, static), Operators(Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise) |
| 05_control_flow | Conditional(if, if-else, switch), Loops(for, while, do-while) and Loop Control(break, continue, return) |
| 06_arrays | Declaration, Initialization(static & dynamic), Types (1D/2D/MD), Problems: Max/min, reverse, duplicates, rotation, Sort |
| 07_string_basics | Declaration, Initialization, Immutability, memory (Heap, SCP) |
| 08_string_operations | length, charAt, indexOf, lastIndexOf, substring, replace, contains, equals, compareTo, case conversion, trim, split |
| 09_string_concatenation | + operator, concat(), StringBuilder, StringBuffer |
| 10_string_conversion | Conversions to/from char array, int, float, boolean using valueOf, parseInt, toString |

| 24_java_codes_1_Normal | Commonly Java coding questions |
| 25_java_codes_2_Tricky | Tricky Java coding questions |

## 🔜 Whats's Next? 
- /generics/                 → Class, Method, Interface, Bounded Types, Wildcards, Collections with Generics :List<String> 
- /multithreading/           → Class, Runnable interface, Anonymous inner classes. Lifecycle, Methods, Priorities, Synchronization, Inter-thread Communication
- /basic_datastructures/     → Hashing (HashMap, HashSet), Heaps
- /basic_algorithms/         → Sorting, Searching, Traversal, Recursion
- /unit_testing_junit/       → Writing simple test cases with JUnit (used in automation)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 8+
- IDE: Eclipse
- Git for version control
- JUnit (in selected programs for testing)

## 💡 Why This Matters

I believe consistent practice is the key to mastery.
